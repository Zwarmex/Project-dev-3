      <p>
        Our team, composed of Samuel Lambert, Gaetan Crabeels, Julien Pollart
        and El-Ajmi Mosbah, is proud to present our brand new web development
        project: an online recipe application. As students in our second year of
        computer science we decided to put our knowledge into practice by
        creating a platform for food lovers around the world. Our goal is to
        provide a simple, fun and intuitive cooking experience for users,
        allowing for the discovery of new recipes, meal planning and the
        creation of personal recipes. We are excited to bring you this
        innovative platform and hope it will be a valuable addition to your
        cooking routine.
